This is a branch of the TangoClaws icon theme for the Claws mailer, containing
some more Tango icons to replace the default ones. It is still far from complete
and might never actually be completed :-)

See http://www.claws-mail.org/ for the Claws mailer, and http://www.claws-mail.org/themes.php
for more themes.

(TODO: describe how to build the theme)
