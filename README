This is a branch of the TangoClaws icon theme for the Claws mailer, containing
some more Tango icons to replace the default ones. It is still far from complete
and might never actually be completed :-)

See http://www.claws-mail.org/ for the Claws mailer, and http://www.claws-mail.org/themes.php
for more themes.

The original TangoClaws theme was created by Frederik Elwert, who writes about it:
"The icons of this theme are based on the work of The Tango Project <http://tango-project.org/>.
Icons that were not present in the Tango icon set were partly created by myself or taken from the
following other Projects:

    * Tango Icons for Thunderbird, by Nico Kaiser
      <https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/2258/>

    * Tango CL theme for Opera, by towolf
      <http://my.opera.com/community/customize/skins/info/?id=3465>
"

So, this modified theme is actually created from four sources:
- the original TangoClaws theme (http://www.claws-mail.org/themes.php)
- the Tango icon theme for Thunderbird (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2258?id=2258&application=thunderbird)
- the original Tango icon set (http://tango.freedesktop.org/)
- other icons that are based on existing Tango icons but are modified a bit (in customIcons/ directory)

The theme can be downloaded from
http://github.com/oliver/tangoclawsextended/tree/master/claws-mail-theme_TangoClawsExt-0.3.tar.gz?raw=true

To build the theme:
- download the TangoClaws tgz from http://www.claws-mail.org/download.php?file=themes/claws-mail-theme_TangoClaws-0.3.tar.gz
  and put it into the directory where the Makefile resides
- download the Tango icons for Thunderbird from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/downloads/file/16375/tango_icons_for_thunderbird-0.7.0-tb.jar
  and also put it that directory
- make sure the original Tango iconset is installed at /usr/share/icons/Tango/
  (you can probably install it through the package manager of your system)
- run make
- this should create a new tgz which contains the new theme.
